# Faire Backend Exercise

### Details:

Using the Faire API*1, you will write a program that accepts an API key as a single command line parameter, which should be sent with all requests in the X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN header, and does the following:

* Consumes all products for a given brand*2, recording the inventory levels for each product option
* Consumes all orders, accepting the order if there is inventory to fulfill the order, otherwise it marks the items that donâ€™t have enough inventory as backordered
* Update the inventory levels of product options as each order is moved to processing
* After all orders have been processed, the program should print the following metrics, plus 2 of your choosing, and then exit - your creativity is welcome!

* The best selling product option
* The largest order by dollar amount
* The state with the most orders

For testing, you can use the API key: HQLA9307HSLQYTC24PO2G0LITTIOHS2MJC8120PVZ83HJK4KACRZJL91QB7K01NWS2TUCFXGCHQ8HVED8WNZG0KS6XRNBFRNGY71
