##### Technical Decision:
* What are the reasons to use a batch solution?

	Once I have worked 7 years for a global company (B2C for ~1.5 million of representatives) where security and availability non functional requirements were the extremely high and the main requirements of this challenger are related to order processing where frontend isn't required, I realized a solution that can run in background not impacting the production environment. 

* What are the reasons to use the spring batch?

	Springbatch is a lightweight batch framework that can be used to develop robust solutions. You can use quartz or any other scheduler to trigger your processes. Additionally, you can control the sequence of 	execution defining steps which can work like a workflow.

* What are the reasons to use the RestTemplate?

	The usage of RestTemplate is recommended because is the easiest and effective way to consume REST Webservices using Spring framework.


### Requirements - Details:

Using the Faire API*1, you will write a program that accepts an API key as a single command line parameter, which should be sent with all requests in the X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN header, and does the following:

* Consumes all products for a given brand*2, recording the inventory levels for each product option
* Consumes all orders, accepting the order if there is inventory to fulfill the order, otherwise it marks the items that donâ€™t have enough inventory as backordered
* Update the inventory levels of product options as each order is moved to processing
* After all orders have been processed, the program should print the following metrics, plus 2 of your choosing, and then exit - your creativity is welcome!

* The best selling product option
* The largest order by dollar amount
* The state with the most orders

For testing, you can use the API key: HQLA9307HSLQYTC24PO2G0LITTIOHS2MJC8120PVZ83HJK4KACRZJL91QB7K01NWS2TUCFXGCHQ8HVED8WNZG0KS6XRNBFRNGY71
